## 5. Business Problem and Step Taken to Solve the Problem

### 1️⃣ Uneven Restaurant Distribution Across Countries & Cities
**Problem:** Restaurants are highly concentrated in a few major countries and cities, while many regions remain under-served.  
**Solution:** Identify high-demand but low-supply regions and focus Zomato’s expansion, restaurant onboarding, and regional marketing in those areas.

---

### 2️⃣ Lack of Online Delivery and Table Booking Options
**Problem:** Many restaurants do not provide online delivery or table booking, reducing customer convenience and engagement.  
**Solution:** Encourage partners to enable these features through incentives and highlight such restaurants in the app after activation.

---

### 3️⃣ Price Range Does Not Always Match Customer Satisfaction
**Problem:** High-priced restaurants do not always have higher ratings or votes; customers value affordability and quality over price.  
**Solution:** Promote value-based pricing and run campaigns like **“Luxury Taste, Local Price”** to boost affordable high-rated restaurants.

---

### 4️⃣ High-Rated Restaurants With Low Votes Remain Hidden
**Problem:** Some restaurants have high ratings but very few votes, resulting in low visibility on the platform.  
**Solution:** Identify these using analytics and increase visibility through featured sections, recommendations, and targeted promotions.
