## 5. Business Problem

The major business problems identified were:

- **Price range may not reflect customer satisfaction**  
  Customers may value food quality and service more than price; overpriced menus lower perceived value  

- **Untracked customer behavior**  
  Restaurants lack insights into behavioral differences between **weekdays vs weekends**

- **Hidden high-quality restaurants**  
  Some restaurants have **high ratings but low votes**, reducing visibility and reach

- **Lack of online/table booking**  
  Many restaurants do not offer bookings, decreasing customer convenience and engagement

## 6. Steps Taken to Solve the Problems

The following actions were taken:

- **Identified hidden restaurants**  
  High-rated but low-voted restaurants were detected to improve visibility through targeted campaigns  

- **Encouraged online/table booking enablement**  
  Performance was compared before and after feature activation  

- **Marketing campaign created**  
  Example theme:  
  **“Luxury Taste, Local Price”**  
  Promoting affordable, highly-rated restaurants to boost engagement and loyalty  

- **Weekday vs Weekend analysis**  
  Compared cuisine preferences and customer behavior trends to help maintain platform quality
